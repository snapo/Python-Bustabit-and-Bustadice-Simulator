# Python-Bustabit-and-Bustadice-Simulator
It just generates numbers from Bust a Dice // Bust a Bit and you can try your strategy. 
It can handle without console output around 2.9 Seconds

To see the numbers please uncomment the print number ... If you do this you need at least 40 seconds for 1 million numbers


The new added CSV has 2 columns and was played for 100'000'000 games
-First column is the crash number
-Second column is the number of games we saw at a maximum where the number was NOT occuring. So for 1.01 it was 5 games. This means there is on 100m games the possibility that 1.0 occurs 5 times in a row.
